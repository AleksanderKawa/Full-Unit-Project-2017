			<div id="InitiatingProcesses" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Initiating Processes</h1>
				<p>One of five main Processes/Process Groups of a Project (ISO 21500 and PMI). It includes defining and authorizing a project or project phase. Initiating processes take place during each phase of a project. For example, in the close-out phase, initiating processes are used to ensure that the project team completes all the work, that someone documents lessons learned, and that the customer accepts the work (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>
			</div>

			<div id="PlanningProcesses" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Planning Processes</h1>
				<p>It comes after the Initiating Processes. What is more, it is the second of the five main Processes/Process Groups of a Project (ISO 21500 and PMI). It includes devising and maintaining a workable scheme to ensure that the project addresses the organizationâ€™s needs. In other words, the project manager needs to stablish a good relationship with the client and ensure that the outcome is a satisfied client. Additionally, spending more time on planning should pay off in execution.</p>
				<p>Projects include several plans, such as the scope management plan, schedule management plan, cost management plan, and procurement management plan. These plans define each knowledge area as it relates to the project at a point in time.  For example, a project team must develop a plan to define the work needed for the project, to schedule activities related to that work, to estimate costs for performing the work, and to decide what resources to procure to accomplish the work. To account for changing conditions on the project and in the organization, project teams often revise plans during each phase of the project life cycle (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>
			</div>

			<div id="ExecutingProcesses" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Executing Processes</h1>
				<p>It comes as the third of the five main Processes/Process Groups of a Project (ISO 21500 and PMI). Executing processes include coordinating people and other resources to carry out the various plans and create the products, services, or results of the project or phase. Examples of executing processes include acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, distributing information, managing stakeholder expectations, and conducting procurements (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>
			</div>

			<div id="MonitoringAndControlling" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Monitoring and Controlling Processes</h1>
				<p>The fourth out of five main Processes/Process Groups of a Project (ISO 21500 and PMI). It includes regularly measuring and monitoring progress to ensure that the project team meets the project objectives. The project manager and staff monitor and measure progress against the plans and take corrective action when necessary. A common monitoring and controlling process is reporting performance, where project stakeholders can identify any necessary changes that may be required to keep the project on track (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>
			</div>

			<div id="ClosingProcesses" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Closing Processes</h1>
				<p>Finally, the fifth main Processes/ Process Groups of a Project (ISO 21500 and PMI). It includes formalizing acceptance of the project or project phase and ending it efficiently. Administrative activities are often involved in this process group, such as archiving project files, closing out contacts, documenting lessons learned, and receiving formal acceptance of the delivered work as part of the phase or project (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>
