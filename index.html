			<p>Nowadays, the key to achieving business goals is to succeed in balancing in business as usual and business changes. But, what makes projects different? Prince2 stands “A project is a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed Business Case.”(The Stationery Office). But generally speaking, a project is carefully planned, usually, involving research or design, that is to achieve specific objectives. It can also be a prearranged in the big corporations or everyday life activities. For instance, a student can make a project about his studies or research. It involves a greater amount of work spent on the project than an assignment. On the other hand, a big company can make a project which will involve a huge amount of employees and much longer time spent on the project. It will also contain costs and generally more factors used to create a project compared to student’s project. Thus, they have something in common, namely, they should be managed through Project Management.</p>

			<p>To begin with, a Guide To The Project Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) stands “Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.”. In general, the Project Management contains two words, “Project” and “Management”. Nevertheless, the project is needed to create or deliver the set goal. On the other hand, the word management stands for “doing best with what is available” (Helicon, 2016). Combining it gives us the possibility, for instance, for a company to manage the schedule, given a plan, on time or even before which benefits with benefits or even financial bonus for the company to be early and not only that.</p>

			Furthermore, in simple words, project management is a project that menage correctly gives benefits in many different ways, for instance as mentioned before, financial. But first, there is a need for identifying its recurring five main processes elements i.e. five Process Groups. These five Process Groups are:
