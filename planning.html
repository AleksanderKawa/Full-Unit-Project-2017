				<h1>Project Scope Management</h1>
				<p>Project scope tells us what exactly the project will deliver. Sometimes, when the scope is wrongly defined or even not defined at all, there may be issues, for instance, the customer may assume that LCD screen and ceramic pedals and included in the price of the car, whereas the supplier views these as <i>extras</i>. Moreover, the larger is the project, the more complex and subtler the scope needs to be. What the PRINCE2 stands “The Project Manager needs to have a detailed understanding of what is and what is not within the scope. The Project Manager should take care not to deliver beyond the scope as this is a common source of delays, overspends and uncontrolled changes (scope creep)”.</p>
				<p>In project management, the term scope has two distinct uses: Project Scope and Product Scope. Scope involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements. 1.Project Scope: "The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions." 2.Product Scope: "The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result." Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented (the hows), while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements (the whats).</p>

				<h1>Project Time Management</h1>
				<p>The importance and probably the most-frequent asked question of a Project Manager is, when will it be finished? Managers are usually on high pressure to finish the project on the given time frame. Additionally, the time can be measured and remembered meaning that the people will remember the project’s completion date, and anyone can quickly estimate schedule performance and how much time they need to finish the given task. The problem is that the time passes no matter what happens on a project so if there are necessary changes or there is a lack of experience how much time can take given project, it may lead to delays and unhappiness of the sponsors or clients. What is more, identifying the timescale requirement for a project can help identify tolerances and timings for benefits reviews (PRINCE2).</p>

				<h1>Project Cost Management</h1>
				<p>Once your business is operational, it's essential to plan and tightly manage its financial performance. Creating a budgeting process is the most effective way to keep your business - and its finances - on track. It is very important for a Project Manager to understand what the cost of a project is because it costs money and can consume resources. Primary, the project needs to be affordable. Nevertheless, even if the budget for the project is set, it is highly possible to overspend or, perhaps, to cut some costs. What PRINCE2 stands “The Business Case should summarize the costs derived from the Project Plan together with the assumptions upon which they are based. The costs should also include details of the ongoing operations and maintenance costs and their funding arrangements.” Additionally, PMBOK Guide viewpoints is that “Project Cost Management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.”. As it can be seen Project Cost Management is very important and it can sometimes determine if the project can be done or if it is not affordable.</p>

			<div id="ProjectQualityManagement" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Project Quality Management</h1>
				<p>PRINCE2 stands “The purpose of the Quality theme is to define and implement the means by which the project will create and verify products that are fit for purpose.” Or “Quality is generally defined as the totality of features and inherent or assigned characteristics of a product, person, process, service and/or system that bear on its ability to show that it meets expectations or satisfies stated needs, requirements or specification.” It is very important of the Project Quality Management to make sure that the quality of a project is not poor. If we accept inferior quality projects, many people will be hurt, for example, corporations depend on technology and if something is wrong they may lose money. Additionally, many IT projects develop mission-critical system that are used in life-and-death situations, for instance, in planes or calculations for building constructions.</p>
