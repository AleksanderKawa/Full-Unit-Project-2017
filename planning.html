				<h1>Project Scope Management</h1>
				<p>In project management, the term scope has two distinct uses: Project Scope and Product Scope. Scope involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements. 1.Project Scope: "The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions." 2.Product Scope: "The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result." Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented (the hows), while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements (the whats).</p>

				<h1>Project Time Management</h1>
				<p>A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.</p>
