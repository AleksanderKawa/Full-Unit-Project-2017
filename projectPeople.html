					<h1>Project HRM</h1>
					<p> People are the most important asset for a company. They determine the success and failure of organizations and projects. That is why the company should take a great care in choosing new employees and effectively manage human resources. What should be added is what the Project teams need:</p>
					<p>- Clear aim or goals</p>
					<p>- Clear objectives</p>
					<p>- Clear leadership</p>
					<p>Note that while all members of a team may share a major aim, they may have different objectives. The project manager, on the other hand, has a number of different roles to fill, for instance, providing motivation, communicating to many people, being able to take a broad view of the project. People need to continually upgrade their skills to remain marketable and flexible. Workers need to know how they personally contribute to an organization’s bottom line and how they can continue to do so (Information Technology Project Management, 2015).</p>

				<div id="ProjectStakeholderManagement" class="tabcontent">
					<h1>Project Stakeholder Management</h1>
					<p>PRINCE2 stands “All projects have the following primary stakeholders:”</p>
					<p><b>‘Business’</b> sponsors who endorse the objectives and ensure that the business investment provides value for money</p>
					<p><b>’Users’</b> who, after the project is completed, will use the products to enable them to gain the intended benefits</p>
					<p><b>’Suppliers’</b> who provide the resources and expertise required by the project (these may be internal or external)</p>
					<p>Stakeholders requests projects, approve them, reject them, support them, and oppose them. They are the people who decide how much money they can invest in the Project. In which direction it should go and if they like the results or not. What is more, PMBOK Guide create an entire knowledge area developed to it because it is so important for the project. It says that “Project Stakeholder Management includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyse stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project, and to develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution. Stakeholder management also focuses on continuous communication with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations, addressing issues as they occur, managing conflicting interests and fostering appropriate stakeholder engagement in project decisions and activities. Stakeholder satisfaction should be managed as a key project objective.”</p>

				<div id="TeamOrganization" class="tabcontent">
					<h1>Team Organization</h1>
					<p>In many organizations the team is a key to success. Moreover, they have several types of team. It affects forms of communication the project needs, and the type disturbs how that team is managed. Furthermore, PMBOK Guide stands “The project team includes the project manager and the group of individuals who act together in performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives. The project team includes the project manager, project management staff, and other team members who carry out the work but who are not necessarily involved with management of the project.”</p>
					<p>There are four major types: functional, project, matrix, and contract. Each form has strengths and weaknesses, for instance, <i>Project</i> has great authority and control but also has high administrative costs. That suit it for types of project within particular organizational cultures.</p>
