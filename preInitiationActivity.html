				<h1>Organizing Projects</h1>
				<p>First of all, it should be answered how a project can be organized. There are many ways, for instance, it can be done within an organization in other words, <b>in-house projects</b>. What is more, all the project work can be put to <b>tender</b> and contracted for (it means that the contractor is able to do all of the project work or can divide it and let parts be done by subcontractors. Last but not least, part or all of a project can be tendered for by <b>consortia</b> of organizations. This is more likely to happen in terms of a great amount of money and other resources that a single contactor cannot finance them by itself.</p>
				<p>In project management the first step is to decide what projects to do in the first place. Bear in mind that to select which project to work on, it needs to be analyse and deeply thought if the selected project is in the best interest of the entire organization. Moreover, it is crucial to have managers from outside the IT department as they can help IT personnel understand organizational strategies and identify the business areas that support them. Next, it would be to perform a business area analysis. This part benefit from IT by achieving strategic goals and helps to determine which processes could help the most. The last stage is to assign resources for working on the IT projects. Lastly, everything comes with a risk and it will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

				<h1>Risk</h1>
				<p>Primary, what is Project Risk? Prince2 stands “An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project objective” or “uncertain of outcome”. Moreover, there are two parts:</p>
				<p>- Risk identification and analysis</p>
				<p>- Risk management</p>
				<p>Risk identification and analysis means assessing the probability of risk occurring and their impact on the project. Additionally, the list of potential risks can be made and when it happens, the preparations will be already managed to deal with it. Risk management, on the other hand, is what the project manager does to counteract or prepare for the risks (Project Management, 2014). What is more, there is also the <i>generic</i> Risk Management process, namely, identify, assess, treat, and control.</p>

				<h1 class="mainActivity">ACTIVITY</h1>
				<p>Think about the relationship a project might have with a primary supplier. Assume that the project stretches over several months or even over a year or more. Take no more than one or two minutes to write doen as many risk factors associated with the supplier as you can think of</p>
				<h2 class="mainActivity">DISCUSSION</h2>
				<p><b>This is a list from a Project Management book:</b></p>
				<p>- The supplier could fail to deliver key components on time</p>
				<p>- The project may not specify the right components</p>
				<p>- The supplier could go out of business during the period of the project</p>

				<h1>Estimating a Project</h1>
				<p>A statement of work (SOW) is a document routinely employed in the field of project management. It defines project-specific activities, deliverables and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. The SOW typically also includes detailed requirements and pricing, with standard regulatory and governance terms and conditions. It is often an important accompaniment to a master service agreement or request for proposal (RFP).</p>
