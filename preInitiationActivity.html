				<h1>Organizing Projects</h1>
				<p>First of all, it should be answered how a project can be organized. There are many ways, for instance, it can be done within an organization in other words, <b>in-house projects</b>. What is more, all the project work can be put to <b>tender</b> and contracted for (it means that the contractor is able to do all of the project work or can divide it and let parts be done by subcontractors. Last but not least, part or all of a project can be tendered for by <b>consortia</b> of organizations. This is more likely to happen in terms of a great amount of money and other resources that a single contactor cannot finance them by itself.</p>
				<p>In project management the first step is to decide what projects to do in the first place. Bear in mind that to select which project to work on, it needs to be analyse and deeply thought if the selected project is in the best interest of the entire organization. Moreover, it is crucial to have managers from outside the IT department as they can help IT personnel understand organizational strategies and identify the business areas that support them. Next, it would be to perform a business area analysis. This part benefit from IT by achieving strategic goals and helps to determine which processes could help the most. The last stage is to assign resources for working on the IT projects. Lastly, everything comes with a risk and it will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

			<div id="Risk" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Risk</h1>
				<p>Primary, what is Project Risk? Prince2 stands “An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project objective” or “uncertain of outcome”. Moreover, there are two parts:</p>
				<p>- Risk identification and analysis</p>
				<p>- Risk management</p>
				<p>Risk identification and analysis means assessing the probability of risk occurring and their impact on the project. Additionally, the list of potential risks can be made and when it happens, the preparations will be already managed to deal with it. Risk management, on the other hand, is what the project manager does to counteract or prepare for the risks (Project Management, 2014). What is more, there is also the <i>generic</i> Risk Management process, namely, identify, assess, treat, and control.</p>

				<h1 class="mainActivity">ACTIVITY</h1>
				<p>Think about the relationship a project might have with a primary supplier. Assume that the project stretches over several months or even over a year or more. Take no more than one or two minutes to write doen as many risk factors associated with the supplier as you can think of</p>
				<h2 class="mainActivity">DISCUSSION</h2>
				<p><b>This is a list from a Project Management book:</b></p>
				<p>- The supplier could fail to deliver key components on time</p>
				<p>- The project may not specify the right components</p>
				<p>- The supplier could go out of business during the period of the project</p>

			<div id="EstimatingAProject" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Estimating a Project</h1>
				<p>Estimating a Project is the process of gathering, organizing, and evaluating data which then are used to develop an estimate for a project. Moreover, Estimating may be done by different people for different purpose, for instance, by a potential contractor for tendering.</p>
				<p><b>There are distinct tasks to be undertaken in the process of estimating:</b></p>
				<p>- List materials, supplies, component parts, etc.</p>
				<p>- Draw up a cost breakdown structure and cross-references</p>
				<p>- Classify items and consolidate them under distinct headings</p>
				<p>- Prepare and present the estimate to management or the client</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>

			<div id="MonitoringAndControlling" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Monitoring and Controlling</h1>
				<p>In many project, especially on large projects, monitoring and controlling is a key part to success. The process of monitoring and controlling communications throughout the entire project life cycle to ensure the information needs of the project stakeholders are met says PMBOK Guide. What is more, monitoring and controlling comes with planning and even thought the plan is set and everything is discussed, changes during the process of creation the project are needed. That is why monitoring and controlling is so important, without it, not all needs of the stakeholders would be developed and highly possible that the project would be closed and abandoned.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="ClosingProjects" class="tabcontent">
				<h1>Closing Projects</h1>
				<p>Closing project or phase is the last part of the initiation management, which requires that you finalize all activities and transfer the completed or cancelled work to the appropriate people (Information Technology Project Management, 2015). What is more, PMBOK Guide stands “The closing process group consists of those processes performed to conclude all activities across all Project Management Process Groups to formally complete the project, phase, or contractual obligations” Finally, it is important to follow all necessary procedures because when giving the project to the sponsors they need to accept it and be happy with the results.</p>
